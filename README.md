# Portfolio-Analytics
Using Python and libraries including yfinance, quantstats to generate html files to view portfolio analytics
The QuantStats Python library can be used to perform portfolio profiling, allowing quants and portfolio managers to understand their performance better by providing them with in-depth analytics and risk metrics.
I have two different files where i have added some code to look at the returns of GLD, QQQ, SPY, a weighted portfolio. Ultimately generating a html file - tearsheet which contains key metrics and other visualizations
